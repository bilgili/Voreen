/**
 * \brief Abstract base class for interaction handlers that can be attached to processors
 * and react to user events. Implement onEvent() in a subclass to receive the events.
 *
 * Each InteractionHandler instance is associated with one or multiple event properties
 * that are used for event filtering: Processor base class passes incoming events
 * to its interaction handlers' event properties. For concrete handlers that only
 * need to react to a single mouse or keyboard event, it usually sufficient to call
 * the appropriate constructor of the InteractionHandler base class, which creates
 * the needed EventProperty. More complex handlers (e.g. CameraInteractionHandler),
 * however, may need to create and add event properties on their own.
 *
 * Since InteractionHandler derives from PropertyOwner, a derived class
 * may also use "normal" (non-event) properties.
